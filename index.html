      <p><b>About Me 🚀:</b></p>
      <p>
        Hey, I'm Saqib Bilal, your tech sidekick! 🤖 College life has
        transformed me into a tech explorer. As they say, "College is a place
        where some pursue learning and others learn sleeping!" Well, I'm
        definitely in the second group, even though I sometimes nap in front of
        my code. 😴
      </p>
      <p>
        As they say, "College is like a fountain of knowledge, and the students
        are there to drink!" So here I am, spilling every drop 💦 from the
        fountain and occasionally sipping a bit too. I've adopted the age-old
        college wisdom: "Life is too important to be taken seriously." So, join
        me on this wild and wacky adventure through the maze of computer
        science. Expect front-row seats to coding calamities, tech troubles, and
        more laughs than you can shake a keyboard at. Just remember, in the
        world of computers, even the "delete" key has a backup plan – and so do
        we! 🤣
      </p>
      <p>
        In the world of academia, they say, "If at first you don't succeed,
        you're not cut out for computer science!" Well, I've taken that as my
        personal challenge, turning every tech mishap into a stepping stone
        toward brilliance. It's all part of the fun in this wild ride through
        the world of codes and bytes. 🌟
