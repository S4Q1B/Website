      <p><b>My Adventures 🌍:</b></p>
      <p>
        In my everyday adventures, I embark on a rollercoaster of 'learning' 📚,
        'coding chaos' 💻, and 'introverted escapades' 🤫, because who needs to
        go to adventures when you can find adventures everyday. 😄

        <li>
          The "Semester's First All-Nighter" Saga:<br />
          💤 Me: "I'll totally stay ahead of the game this semester!"<br />
          😱 Reality: It's 3 AM, and I'm learning more about everything except
          my actual courses.

        <li>
          The "Exam Cram Jam" Jam: <br />
          📚 Me: "I'll start studying well in advance."<br />
          ⏰ Reality: D-Day has arrived, and my study materials remain
          untouched. It's time for a cramming marathon with a side of panic
          attacks.

        <li>
          The "Sleepy Classroom Symphony": <br />
          😴 Me: "I'll stay awake in class."<br />
          🎶 Reality: Falling asleep in the middle of a lecture, snoring like
          I'm auditioning for a choir.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The "Forgotten Password Hysteria": <br />
          🔐 Me: "I'll remember my password this time." <br />
          ❓ Reality: Locked out of my accounts, I try every combination under
          the sun, but no luck.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The "Social Interaction Level: Potato" Situation: <br />🤷 Me: "I
          should go out and meet people."<br />
          💬 Reality: Achievement unlocked: I changed my mood after realizing
          I'm an introvert and not in the mood for talking.
